<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!--[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->
<p>
Purchasing expensive products for short term use is not a viable option for many people. Therefore, 
many tend to rent the products when necessary. However, as we all have experienced, finding a 
product to rent is a tedious task. “Huwamaruwa” is a product rental app focused on Sri Lankan 
community that connects product owners and customers directly. The main intention of this app is to 
streamline the product rental process while exposing new opportunities for ordinary people to earn an 
extra income by renting out the products they own. They can rent out household products under 
several categories such as electronics, kitchen wares, outdoor tools and books. This app also enables 
equipment rental shops and individuals to take their operations online with a mobile-first rental 
solution. 
</p><p>
“Huwamaruwa” app allows customers to easily discover products they are looking to rent, see their 
availability and rental prices through the online store. In order to enable equal opportunities to 
everyone we are planning to implement, two types of rental products known as Premium and nonpremium. As the rental process involves some risk and products should be handled properly, we have 
implemented premium products category where our service team acts as middle party between 
customer and the product owner. Moreover, our delivery team picks up the product from the owner 
and delivers to the customer. The products are carefully inspected before delivering and returning. This 
ensures the safety of the product and the seller’s lost will be covered in case of product damage. 
Premium product customers will always get quality products at an extra cost. 
</p><p>
Non premium products don’t involve our intervention and seller and buyer should arrange the deal 
themselves. This category connects both parties directly and we expect this feature may persuade 
many people to use the app. 
</p>
Product owners can list the items and send offers to buyer requests. They can also manage all 
necessary functions such as edit or delete listings. Buyers can rent products, review them or request 
new products. Once reservations have been made online, premium product customers can pay for 
their rental through the app. A variety of methods, from credit cards to cash on delivery are supported. 
Admin functions such as delivery management and customer support are also built into the app.
